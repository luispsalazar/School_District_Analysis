# School District Analysis - Module 4 Challenge

## Background

The school board suspects academic dishonesty; specifically, reading and math grades for Thomas High School ninth graders appear to have been altered.

The school board does not know the full extent of this situation, but they want to investigate and analyze it, by replacing the "math and reading scores" for Thomas High School with NaNs, while keeping the rest of the data intact.

Once the math and reading scores are replaced, a comparison will be made with the initial data to see if these changes affected the overall analysis.

To accomplish this, Python/Jupyter Notebook will be used to:
*   capture the raw data - read.csv
*   replace the scores with NaN values - loc.
*   filter the data for each grade - loc.
*   determine indicators for analysis - count, mean, sum
*   format results - map, bins, groupby

## Deliverable 1

The "loc." method is used to select all the "reading" and "math" **scores** from the ninth grade at Thomas High School.

    1.1 A comparison operator is used to retrieve all the rows with Thomas High School in the "school_name" column of the student_data_df

    1.2 A comparison operator is used to retrieve all the rows with the ninth grade in the "grade" column of the student_data_df

    1.3 Logical and comparison operators are used to retrieve all the rows with the "reading_score" column for Thomas High School ninth graders from the student_data_df

The above three steps can be seen in the following screenshot, including the replacement of the reading scores with NaN.

    1.4 Logical and comparison operators are used to retrieve all the rows with the "math_score" column for Thomas High School ninth graders from the student_data_df

Similarly, the replacement of the Math Scores can be seen hereafter.

    1.5 The reading and math scores for the ninth graders in Thomas High school are replaced with NaN as shown in the following screenshot.
